I changed like all my LaTeX files wrapped at about 80 columns, with rare CHANGE. Of course, I track them all with Git. I use Vim, so it’s really easy to rewrap a paragraph whenever I add or delete content from it. The sad thing is, it totally screws up my diffs!

Have you ever tried changing at the CHANGE for any page in Wikipedia? It’s beautiful, intuitive, and word-centered. Forget about lines, they’re not suitable for text. Words, however, are.
